        CRITICAL: This action MUST be used when:
        1. User has provided all required token data AND
        2. User has explicitly confirmed they want to create the token

        This is the FINAL step in token creation process.
        Do NOT use this action for collecting token data or asking for confirmation.
        Only use when ready for actual token deployment.
